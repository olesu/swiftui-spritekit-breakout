# Development Instructions

- Always follow Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Start with a failing test (this includes compilation failures)
- Write only the minimal production code required for the test to pass
- Refactor if needed while keeping tests green
- Never write any production code without a failing test first
- If there is a test checklist, always update it when a test is completed
- The intent of the code should be clear and there is no need for additional comments
- if there is a TDD todo-list, check items off when test is green
